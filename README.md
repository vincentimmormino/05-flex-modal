# 05-flex-modal
This project helped me better understand more complex flex layouts. I had to edit both the
CSS and HTML to achieve the correct appearance; specifically, I had to group the middle content
together in a div (originally, the close button was between the header and text in the HTML).

I've been struggling to grasp flex-grow and flex-shrink in practice, but I had a bit of an "aha"
moment in this project with flex-shrink. They're both things I understand on paper, but have a
hard time implementing in projects. I feel like this project helped me with that!
